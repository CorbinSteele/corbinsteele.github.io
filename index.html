      This site is continuously being updated with new projects, code examples, and blog posts
      pertaining to C#, Java, and occasionally static web design. The goal of this website is to act
      as a public repository containing the author's personal portfolio, as well as current and future project ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      All projects on the site are designed to be executable from within the browser with minimal effort,
      while simultaneously not impeding the user from running the software on their local machine if they so desire.
      C# projects are deployed using ClickOnce, which unfortunately requires either Internet Explorer or the download of
      a browser-specific extension, which can be downloaded and installed automatically on launch. Java projects are
      deployed through the JavaFX Deployment Toolkit and run within the browser itself.
