A client-to-client Blackjack program that implements animation of custom controls in C# using only the basic 
.NET libraries. Is still in an early version, intended only to be usable by expressly invited friends. Look forward 
to an improved and more flexible version in the not too distant future, possibly using Photon Cloud.
