A simple program that allows you to generate your own sliding puzzle game, specifying custom dimensions and any 
image from your own computer for the game. Has multiple options to customize the appearance, 
a sliding tile randomizer that allows you to watch as the game shuffles itself before play, an automatic solver to show you how it's done, and a reset feature.
