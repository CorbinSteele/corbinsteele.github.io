projects:
  - name: Sliding Puzzle Generator

    description: |
      A simple program that allows you to generate your own sliding puzzle game, specifying custom dimensions and any
      image from your own computer for the game. Has multiple options to customize the appearance, 
      a sliding tile randomizer, an automatic solver, and a reset feature. All with entertaining animations!
  - name: Backlog Manager

    description: |
      A Java FX web applet that reads and writes backlogs (i.e. TODO lists) through Github. Functionally, it doesn't appear to contain much,       but it persists data as XML files in a separate Github repo through the Github API. As such, it serves as a proof of concept for a very       lightweight cloud storage solution.
  - name: Blackjack

    description: |
      A client-to-client Blackjack program that implements animation of custom controls in C# using only the basic 
      .NET libraries. Is still in an early version, intended only to be usable by expressly invited friends. Look forward 
      to an improved and more flexible version in the not too distant future, possibly using Photon Cloud.
