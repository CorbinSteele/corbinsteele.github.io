A Java FX web applet that reads and writes backlogs (i.e. TODO lists) through Github. Functionally, it doesn't appear to contain much, but it persists data as XML files in a separate Github repo through the Github API. As such, it serves as a proof of concept for a very lightweight cloud storage solution.
