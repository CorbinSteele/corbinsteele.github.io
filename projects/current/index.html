      This very website! I expect this website to remain one of my current projects indefinitely, as I hope to always 
      have more content to add. It's at the top of my list right now as the website is still in its developmental stages, 
      but before very long it will move to the bottom of this list and serve as a foundation for everything above it!
  - name: Sliding Puzzle Generator 2.0

      This consists of designing and implementing an automatic solving algorithm that works with the existing code. 
      There may be minor UI changes and addition of options, as well as some minor refactoring of old code. Expect 
      periodic updates to this project over the next month, with a full version 2.0 by the end!

      Look forward to an improved and more flexible version in the not too distant future, possibly using Photon Cloud. 
      This requires a complete rework of the underlying networking and most of the program flow to allow for more 
      flexibility in the future. This is my first time working with Photon, so I have no strong opinions about it yet.

      A basic, Scrum-inspired desktop application allowing for easy tracking of productivity. In the earliest stages 
      of design and planning. It's currently being designed to be coded using JavaFX, which is a completely new GUI 
      framework for me. It's low on my list of priorities, but I still expect some form of concrete progress within 2-3 months.
