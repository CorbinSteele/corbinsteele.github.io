      This very website! I expect this website to remain one of my current projects indefinitely, as I hope to always 
      have more content to add. It's at the top of my list right now as the website is still in its developmental stages, 
      but before very long it will move to the bottom of this list and serve as a foundation for everything above it!
  - name: Backlog Manager 2.0

      A basic, Scrum-inspired web application allowing for easy tracking of backlogs. Completely functional, although currently a very barebones implementation. It's coded using JavaFX with some FXML, and utilizes the Github API to persist data. The next step is adding enough functionality to make it useful day-to-day.
  - name: Sliding Puzzle Generator 2.0

      This largely consists of minor UI changes and addition of options, as well as some minor refactoring of old code. 
      New options include custom sizing of puzzles, custom animation speeds, a move counter, a default picture, and more.
      This is a low priority, relaxing side project. Everyone needs one!
  - name: Blackjack 2.0

      Look forward to an improved and more flexible version in the distant future, possibly using Photon Cloud. 
      This requires a complete rework of the underlying networking and most of the program flow to allow for more 
      flexibility. This project has not yet been started, and is more of an idea in the back of my mind.
