      This very website! I expect this website to remain one of my current projects indefinitely, as I hope to always 
      have more content to add. It's at the top of my list right now as it's still in its developmental stages, but before 
      very long it will move to the bottom of this list and serve as a foundation for everything above it!

      Look forward to an improved and more flexible version in the not too distant future, possibly using Photon Cloud. 
      This requires a complete rework of the underlying networking and most of the program flow to allow for more 
      flexibility in the future. This is my first time working with Photon, so I have no strong opinions about it yet.
