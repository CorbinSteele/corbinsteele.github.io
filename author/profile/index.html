      Programmer, software designer, technology pioneer. I'm constantly seeking new ideas and 
      unique utilization of software, both the old and the new. I've been programming and investing 
      in self study for over five years now, but the greatest advances in my skill have come in small, 
      short bursts of only a few months at a time. It is my belief that with passion and more than a 
      little effort, anyone can make great progress in gaining the skills and knowledge necessary to achieve their goals.
